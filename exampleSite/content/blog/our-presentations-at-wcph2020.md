# Analysis, advocacy and action at WCPH2020

<br>

#### 16th World Congress on Public Health

<br>

##### 12-16 October, 2020

<br>

At the WCPH2020, our team is presenting several different public health projects, as well as our [abstract](https://collectivize.health/blog/post-5/) about using AI for mental health analysis and prediction in school surveys.

Our presentations and talks reflect the conference themes of **analysis**, **advocacy** and **action**!

**Amanda** is presenting an economic evaluation of the decriminalization of sex work in Washington, DC, USA, which was the topic of her master's thesis research.

**Sami** is presenting on how we can take a human-centered design approach in developing AI-based solutions using existing technologies.

As part of the plenary session #6, **Pete** is talking about the opportunities and challenges facing current public health graduates as they try and break into the job market during COVID19.
